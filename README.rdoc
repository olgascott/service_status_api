== Tiny app for submitting and showing service status

To set a status, send a POST request to /api/1/reports with json containing message and status. It is possible to create a report only with a status or only with a message. If status key is being passed, value can only be 'up', 'down' or nil.

To view the latest 10 messages and a current status, open a root route of the app in a browser.
